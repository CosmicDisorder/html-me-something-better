            <h3 class="emphasized">Due to the nature of our new client demographic, everybody up in here needs to learn a thing or two about grape-booze. The goal is to connect with customers and deliver the best service you can, the service quality our followers have come to expect. We're not expecting everyone to become experts about wine. The expectation is that everyone learns the basic of each category, how to describe each of our products, and be able to suggest pairings. This won't happen overnight. We actually look forward to doing tasting staff on all our products over time using the information provided in the portal as a guideline.

            <p>This is our happy hour red. It has aromas of blueberries, pomegranates and fresh herbs. A balance of silky tannins and ripe fruit with moderate acidity. </p>

            <h3 id="sean-minor">Sean Minor - Pinot Noir, 2017</h3>
            <p> A medium bodied wine which displays aromas of strawberry, chery cola and raspberry fruit. On the palate, the Pinot offers bright and approachable flavors of cherry and strawberry, combined with subtle layers of spice. Bright acidity combined with sweet oak results in a lingering finish </p>

            <h3 id="santa-ema">Santa Ema - Merlot, 2016</h3>
            <p>This deep violet-ruby red wine is very fruity with notes of plums and blackberries accompanied by intense and unmistakable notes of carmael, vanilla and choclate. The palate is smooth with ripe tannins, good structure, and very good balance. Accompanies red and white meats, pastas, game, and cheese. </p>
